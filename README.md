# Installation

- When you have them just navigate to the main page of the repository and download or clone the project (.zip file). 
- Add the project folder to your AMPPS projects directory ("../Ampps/www/"). 
- Import file ("../database/seeds/dump1.sql") into MySQL Workbench in order to be able to use the existing database schema.
